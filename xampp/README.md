# XAMPP

**This __"install"__ incorporates XAMPP as an app and sets an icon for it.** The actual install is done by running the downloadable file from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

When placing projects in the _htdocs_ folder make sure to run `sudo chwon -R $USER:$USER <project>` to enable editing. If you are working with Laravel, `sudo chmod 777 -R <laravel_project>/storage` will also be required.
